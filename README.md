# dev-portfolio2022
<h1>Revamped and updated dev portfolio</h1>

<h3>Reason For Revamp</h3>
<p>My original portfolio site was created last year in a mad rush to reach my deliverable deadline for the Software Engineering Immersive bootcamp I was in through General Assembly. Given the timeframe for the project, my focus was to meet the MVP (minimum viable product) requirements on time, without really getting to put the thought into it that I would have liked. Don't get me wrong - it is functional and looks good, but I want to better showcase my front-end skills instead of relying solely on a framework. For a project of this size, Bootstrap feels a bit overkill.</p>

<h3>Immediate Goals</h3>
<p>To create a responsive, streamlined user experience that showcases my front-end and design skills.</p>
<h4>User Stories:</h4>
<ul>
<li>When a user navigates to the home page, they will see a nav bar with my name, and links to "About Me", "Portfolio", "Contact", and "Résumé".</li>
<li>If user is on a mobile device, nav bar will show hamburger icon. On hover, hamburger icon will display dropdown with links to "About Me", "Portfolio", "Contact", and "Résumé".</li>
<li>When user scrolls down page, they will see:
<ol>
<li>About Me section with photo</li>
<li>Projects with descriptions, technologies used, and links to view each</li>
<li>Contact section with icon links to social media and coding accounts, and an email link</li>
<li>Footer</li>
</ol>
</ul>

<h3>Fun Enhancements</h3>
<p>Additions that I would like to make to show off a bit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scroll animation</li>
<li>Button animations</li>
<li>Photo carousel for project screenshots</li>
<li>Buttons for "light" and "high contrast" modes (default is dark mode)</li>
<li>Coding blog</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a dynamic and growing list, so stay tuned for more updates!</p>
